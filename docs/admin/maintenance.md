# Maintenance

Each component of the MLOps BB will continue to evolve, and stability of the latest releases
is not always guaranteed. We recommend pinning the tags of your images to specific versions
if you don't want to live on the edge.

It is still also recommended to follow the changes of the components since the releases you
are using. Last recommendation still stands, you _should_ avoid "latest" tags, but it is important
to upgrade to the most recent releases to be more up-to-date. Stalling versions is also not
good for security, by updating you get versions with fresher dependencies, which is better for
you deployment security.
